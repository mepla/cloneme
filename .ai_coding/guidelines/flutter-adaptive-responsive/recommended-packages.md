## Packages to Avoid

### Packages with Low Adoption
- Most packages with < 50 likes and < 1000 downloads
- Experimental packages without regular updates
- Packages that duplicate functionality of better alternatives

### Deprecated or Unmaintained
- Check last update date before adopting
- Verify active issue resolution
- Ensure compatibility with latest Flutter versions

## Integration Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
Begin with one core package (like `flutter_screenutil`) and add others as needed.

### 2. Avoid Conflicts
Don't combine multiple packages that solve the same problem unless necessary.

### 3. Follow Package Conventions
Each package has its own sizing conventions - be consistent within your app.

### 4. Test Across Devices
Always test your responsive implementation across different screen sizes and devices.

### 5. Performance Considerations
Monitor performance impact, especially with comprehensive frameworks.

## Native Flutter Alternatives

Before adding packages, consider using Flutter's built-in responsive capabilities:

- **MediaQuery**: For screen information
- **LayoutBuilder**: For constraint-based layouts
- **SafeArea**: For device-specific padding
- **Flexible/Expanded**: For flexible layouts
- **AspectRatio**: For maintaining proportions
- **FractionallySizedBox**: For percentage-based sizing

These native solutions are often sufficient for many responsive design needs and don't add external dependencies to your project.

## Final Recommendations

1. **For beginners**: Start with `flutter_screenutil` + `auto_size_text`
2. **For comprehensive solutions**: Use `responsive_framework`
3. **For Material Design**: Combine `adaptive_breakpoints` with native Flutter widgets
4. **For complex apps**: Consider `responsive_framework` + specialized packages as needed
5. **Always prefer native solutions** when they meet your requirements

Remember to evaluate each package based on your specific needs, project constraints, and team expertise.
