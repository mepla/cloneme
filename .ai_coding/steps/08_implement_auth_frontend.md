read the .ai_coding/plans/frontend_auth_implementation.md and look at the exsiting backend/ implementation to do this:

* Ultra-think for this.
* Implement only the login and sign up pages on the frontend that works with the backend endpoints.
* Don't implement the Role-based navigation after authentication for now.
* Just let the users signup/login/forget/refresh and just redirect them to a place holder page after they login, with a logout button so I can do the whole process again
* Use the dart mcp server to implement this properly
