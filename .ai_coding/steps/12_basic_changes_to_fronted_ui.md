In the current frontend implementation that mostly has mock data:

* Ultra-think for this.
* Create a tabbar to provide an entry point to the content page and coach chatting page
* In the web version, render all the content in a middle column so it quite closely reflects the mobile UI and try to keep it that way as much as possible throughout the app. 
* Use playwright to open the web version and fix all the wrong aspect ratios and pixel overloads that currently exist.
* Make changes and look at it with Playwright until the app looks visually appealing on the web and has proper entry points to the content feed, coach chat pages and user profile page.
