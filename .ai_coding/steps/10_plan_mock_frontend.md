read the .ai_coding/main_spec.md and look at the exsiting backend/ and /frontend implementation to do this:

* Ultra-think for this.
* DO NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WRITE OR CHANGE CODE, ONLY PLAN AND WRITE SPECS AT THIS POINT.
* The signup and login flow is already implemented in frontend/ so skip that.
* Plan the implementation of the rest of the frontend app and mock everything in .ai_coding/plans. \
* Create proper API calling classes but for now just return a mock response from them. We will later implement each backend call one by one.
