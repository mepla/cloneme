read the .ai_coding/plans/backend_implementation_plan.md and do the following:

* Ultra-think for this.
* Implement only the authentication feature of the backend:
  * Essentially implement a functional version of all API endpointsin "app/api/v1/auth.py" as planned.
  * Do not create any data models, databse tables, code or anything else unless it's absolutely necessary for authentication workflow.
  * The final goal of this is to build the same feature on the frontend and test the signup and login end to end. But for now, you don't need to implement the front end.
