read the .ai_coding/main_spec.md and look at the exsiting backend/ and /frontend implementation to do this:

* Ultra-think for this.
* DO NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WRITE OR CHANGE CODE, ONLY PLAN AND WRITE SPECS AT THIS POINT.
* The signup and login flow is already implemented in frontend/ so skip that.
* Plan the implementation of the Creator dashboard, the dashboard should visually and functionally be very close to the following code: '/Users/mepla/Downloads/Creator Dashboard Setup'
* All data in it should be mock at this point, we will build the backend integration one by one later on.
* Users after login should be redirected to this dashboard
