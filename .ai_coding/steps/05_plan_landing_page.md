read the .ai_coding/main_spec.md and do the following:

* DO NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WRITE OR CHANGE CODE, ONLY PLAN AND WRITE SPECS AT THIS POINT.
* Think really heard for this.
* Plan the implementation of just the landing page in detail and write it separately to .ai_coding/plans/ in an MD file. Think really hard and use all MCPs at your disposal when needed. Make these implementation plans in a way that you can best follow later, we will build each of them together at a later stage.
* Document the color scheme for light and dark mode.
* If the main_spec is not complete yet, try to map out the best you can, I will provide more in it later when needed.
* Do not estimate the work in your plans.
