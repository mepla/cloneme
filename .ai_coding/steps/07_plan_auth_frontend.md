read the .ai_coding/main_spec.md and look at the exsiting backend/ implementation to do this:

* Ultra-think for this.
* DO NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WRITE OR CHANGE CODE, ONLY PLAN AND WRITE SPECS AT THIS POINT.
* Plan the implementation of just the signup/login feature of the frontend project in detail and write it separately to .ai_coding/plans/ in an MD file.
* Use the dart mcp server to plan this
* Use the same light and dark theme and similar aesthetics as frontend/ for the flutter frontend.O
* If the main_spec is not complete yet, try to map out the best you can, I will provide more in it later when needed.
* Do not estimate the work in your plans.
