I want you to update the flutter-multiplatform-development-guide.md we created together before. Do the following:

* Use playwright to look at this demo project: https://abuanwar072.github.io/core_dashboard/
  * Click on different parts of it and look around
  * Pay attention to the sign up and login pages
* You can find the full code repository for that demo project here: https://github.com/abuanwar072/Flutter-Responsive-Admin-Panel-or-Dashboard 
* The behaviour of this demo project is very very close to what I want to achieve in our frontend/ here.
* Ultra think about the example code and compare it to flutter-multiplatform-development-guide.md we have here. Update the guide by taking inspiration from the demo codebase.
* Do not change fundamental decisions in our project such as using bloc instead of provider.
