# EverMynd
EverMynd is a human-centric AI coaching platform that enables personalised coaching at scale.

## Project description
Evermynd is a coaching platform that enables coaches, instructors, educators and experts provide personalized one on one coaching to their audience at scale.

Creators are able to create an AI version of themselves by ingesting all their public (Youtube, Instagram, Tiktok, etc) and private (documents, courses, scripts, etc) content. Their AI replica would have the same tone of writing and talking. They can then sell their own AI coaches to their audience in a subscription model.

Their users will then have access to the EverMynd app and they can talk to their own AI coach and learn multi-modally (text chat, generated visuals, generated podcasts, verbal chat, etc.). In order to keep the users engaged, they will also have an autogenrated and hyperpersonalised content feed that gets populated by AI coaches they are subscribed to and helps them jump back into the conversation with their coaches without needing to initiate a text chat themselves. Users interactions, preferences and engagement with different content is kept as user memory. Every user/coach pair then would have their shared "progress" and preferences of the user that helps the AI coach to personalise their teachings and content even more to the user.

## Project features

### The creators' dashboard
* Creators are able to signup/login into a web dashboard
* Creators are regular users that have the Creator role assigned to their user. 
* They can ingest their own data, with the following options:
  * Youtube: they just need to provide a youtube channel link and all video transcriptions will be ingested in the background.
  * Instagram: they just provide an instagram page and all the visual content and video transcriptions are ingested in the background.
  * Files: pdf, epub, markdown
* Each creator user can create multiple Coaches, Coaches are what end users interact with. 
* Each Coach that a creator creates can have access to all or part of the knowledge graph they created. All nodes and realtions that are created by a creator are marked with their user_id but also marked with the coach_id.
  * It should be possible for a creator to create a coach that has only access to a portion of their full knowledge graph.
* They will be able to configure their AI coach in a few areas:
  * They can provide a list of questions and answers they expect their AI coaches to adhere to, to ensure quality assurance.
  * They can configure certain available features such as: voice chat, preview of their own content when they are referenced in the AI coaches' responses.
  * Subscription pricing tier.
* They are able to publish their AI coach and receive a link. That link would then enable the users to login/signup in the Evermynd user app and purchase a subscription to their coach.
* Test the end to end chat workflow with all the features: multi-modality, memory, progress, voice chat, etc. 

### The user app
#### Coach chat page
* For each AI coach the user is subscribed to, they have a chatbot interface to interact with that particular coach. This page is very similiar to what a regular ChatGPT chatbot interface is.
* The user has the ability to attach images and documents to share as context with their coach.
* If in coach responeses, there are references back to the original content that was ingested, those references are shown to the user with the ability to preview them. If the reference is a Youtube video they should be able to preview it in the chat interface, if it's from the creators' book or documents, it should bring up a book preview for user, etc.

#### Home content page
* The home page in the app is a content feed, very similar to Instagram's home page. 
* At the top you see the avatars of the coaches you are subscribed to and clicking on any of them would bring you the the coach's chat page.
* In the page we see an endless scroll of content that are auto generated by AI coaches the user is subscribed to.
* Every post is completely personalised for the user and considers the progress, preferences and overall memory we have created for the user by chatting and interacting with posts.
* Each post does not need a like, dislike or share button, just a save button.
* There's no commenting on posts either
* Posts have different types, they could be simple images, videos, carousels or dynamically created components on the client side. Posts can enable interactivity by:
  * Asking a question to the user
  * Showing a poll
  * Redirect them back to the coach chat page and use the context of the post to prompt their AI coach to continue the conversation on the post's topic.

### Public landing page
* A creator focused landing page that explains the product to coaches, authors, creators and educators. 
* The main goal of the landing page is to show creators how they can monteize using Evermynd and
* They should learn what the experience would look like, both for them and their audience (a visual summary of the creator dashboard and user app features).
* The landing page's design is very modern and professional with interactive elements.

## Tech Stack

The whole stack for Evermynd is broken down into 3 different projects:
* App frontend
* App backend
* Public landing page

The frontend web app will include both the end user functionalities and creator dashboard functionalities. Each creator is a regular user and they can become a creator by either using the option in their account settings or by signing up through a creator specific signup link. The mobile app versions of the frontend will only have end user functionalities, so no creator dashboard.

### App backend
* Python 3.12+
* Use graphiti to create the knowledge graph and rag pipelines of creator's knowledge base (The same knowledge graph model can be used to track user's preferences, progress and memory). Use zep-docs mcp to fully understand how to use Graphiti. Pay attention that you must not use zep cloud solutions, just the Graphiti open source library.
* Authentication is done through Supabase, all frontend calls to the backend must be authenticated an authorized for the resource they are accessing. 
* Each user has a set of roles assigned to them. Right now it can be: Consumer, Creator, Admin. Each user can have multiple roles assigned to the. There needs to be an RBAC system to only authorize right access to right user roles.  For example: a user with just the consumer role can not create a Coach, but the Creator role can. 

### App frontend
* Flutter 3.35+
* Use the dart MCP to explore libraries, plan and implement
* Flutter app built for responsive Web, Android and iOS
  
### Public landing page
* Vue.js
* Tailwind CSS
* Use shadcn MCP to plan, design and implement this
* Light and dark mode, with ability to switch
